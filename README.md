Rails.application.configure do
  # ...
  config.x.bulkgate_sms_gateway_contract = 'BulkgateSmsGatewayContract::Real'

rescue BulkgateSmsGatewayContract::BulkgateError => e
  puts "rescue any API specific error form Bulkgate"
end

# or

begin
  BulkgateSmsGatewayContract.contract.send_sms(country: 'sk', number: 'this-is-wrong', body: '666666 is your Authentication code')
rescue BulkgateSmsGatewayContract::BulkgateError, 'invalid_phone_number'
  puts "phone number invalid"
end

# or gem also provides custom error classes for most common errors like

rescue BulkgateSmsGatewayContract::EmptyMessageBody

rescue BulkgateSmsGatewayContract::OutOfCredit
```

> see https://help.bulkgate.com/docs/en/api-error-types.html#error-types for full list off error types

#### Test

This is actuall Test contract

If you don't know what Test contracts are please read:
https://blog.eq8.eu/article/explicit-contracts-for-rails-http-api-usecase.html


```ruby
#config/environments/test.rb

Rails.application.configure do
  # ...
  config.x.bulkgate_sms_gateway_contract = 'BulkgateSmsGatewayContract::Mock'
  # ...
end
```

Example RSpec usage:

```ruby
require 'rails_helper'
RSpec.describe 'sending of SMS' do
  def trigger
    BulkgateSmsGatewayContract.contract.send_sms(
      country: "sk",
      number: 908111222,
      body: "Your 2FA code is 1234")
   end

  it do
    expect(trigger).to eq "Bulkgate: Your 2FA code is 1234 TO: sk:908111222"
  end
end
```

#### Development

Will log SMS codes to `log/sms.log`

```ruby
#config/environments/development.rb

Rails.application.configure do
  # ...
  config.x.bulkgate_sms_gateway_contract = 'BulkgateSmsGatewayContract::FileLog'
  # ...
end
```

### Bonus - Production with Airbrake Debugging

If you are using [Airbrake](https://github.com/airbrake/airbrake) you
can use for production debugging `AirbrakeNotify` contract

```ruby
# config/environments/production.rb

# This contract is not loaded by default. You need to explicitly require it
require 'sms_gateway_contract/airbrake_notify'

# ...
  config.x.bulkgate_sms_gateway_contract = 'BulkgateSmsGatewayContract::AirbrakeNotify'
# ...
```

> `BulkgateSmsGatewayContract::AirbrakeNotify` is only for debugging production. It's more a lazy tool to save cost during develompment. Don't use it once live.
